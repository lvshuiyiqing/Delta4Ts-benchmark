----------------------------------------------
v0 to v1
----------------------------------------------
This is a very minor revision.

----------------------------------------------
v1 to v2
----------------------------------------------
There are some important changes to the
methods sed uses to compile and execute 
commands.

----------------------------------------------
v2 to v3
----------------------------------------------
Includes changes like bug fixes and
performance "tweaks".

----------------------------------------------
v3 to v4
----------------------------------------------
Another minor revision.

----------------------------------------------
v4 to v5
----------------------------------------------
This version shift is the largest we have
in our repository.

The development of sed v4 to v5 spans almost
5 years!  Needless to say, the differences
between sed.c from v4 and sed.c from v5
are astounding--nearly every "major" function
has been changed significantly.

For the SIR project, this version change
represents the sometimes dramatic changes a 
piece of software can endure when new 
developers work on the project (as is the case
with sed, in this example).

Consider v5 the "overhaul" version that brings
sed from its more archaic (mid 90s IS archaic!)
versions to the versions most users probably
have installed on their workstations (i.e.
versions in the 4.1.*+range)

----------------------------------------------
v5 to v6
----------------------------------------------
This revision allows for some interesting
fault insertion.

----------------------------------------------
v6 to v7
----------------------------------------------
Yet another farily large "leap" from true
sed versions that we're using for SIR.
Thankfully, the changes are not nearly as 
messy as v4 to v5 and allow for plenty of
areas to embed mistakes.
